# Disaster-Tweet-Classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not.

## Project Overview
The dataset consists of tweets labeled as "Disaster" or "Not Disaster." Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project preprocesses textual data, extracts meaningful features, and trains a classification model.

## Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of features to improve the model's accuracy, such as word embeddings
- **Model Training**: Comparison of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to select the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation**: Performance assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
